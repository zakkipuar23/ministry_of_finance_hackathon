# Ministry of Finance Hackathon
Ministry of finance held hackathon with theme health & finance. 

Our team create dashboard to analyze expenditure health budget whether the usage is already right on target or not. We analyze six crucial problem in Indonesia, but choose West Java first as the benchmark for other province in the future. We choose West Java since it's one of the province with the biggest budget, yet it provides good data availability in its website. 

### The six crucial problem that we analyzed are : 
- percentage of stunting 
- number of death due to dengue fever per population
- number of TBC case per population 
- number of hospital and public health center with medicine & vaccine availability > 80%
- number health facility per population
- number of health worker per population 

### for more detail, please see the pdf file and Power BI dashboard that I attach in this repository.
